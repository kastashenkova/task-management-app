## 📦 Setup
### Docker configuration
Steps to reproduce below.
1. Copy `.env.sample` file to new `.env` file
2. Fill your `.env` file with required environment variables
3. Run Docker application
   
### Third-party API integration
#### ⭐ Dropbox Database
Just fill your `.env` file with appropriate variable by generating your own Dropbox access token

<img width="200" height="269" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/283f0857-8d2b-42ff-b2fb-f7027a7cf20b" />

> You can also join Dropbox in the way like we join Google Calendar API now (see below). OAuth 2.0 can give you more flexibility and safety; nevertheless, Dropbox API access token is easier to implement and works quicker locally.

#### ⭐ WhatsApp notification
Task assignment notifications are sent via WhatsApp Business API (Meta Cloud API).

<img width="200" height="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28c7969c-9c16-43ac-8646-2950764b3517" />

> Due to Meta's policy, the system can only send free-form text messages to a user
within a **24-hour window** after that user sends a message to the business account first. Each assignee must send any message to the business WhatsApp number before they can receive task notifications.

1. Do not forget to fill your `.env` file with appropriate variables by setting up your own Meta API
2. Open WhatsApp
3. Add the business number to your contacts: `+1 555 145 2899` (or your configured number)
4. Send any message, for example `start`
5. After that, task assignment notifications will be delivered automatically
> If the 24-hour window expires, you must send a message again to reactivate notifications.

#### ⭐ Google Calendar event invitation
> Due to Google's policy, the system can join the feature of sending Google Calendar event (task) invitation to users only manually through OAuth 2.0 standard.

Steps to reproduce below.
1. Do not forget to fill your `.env` file with appropriate variables by setting up your own Google Cloud API. Mind to add your `/api/auth/google/callback` endpoint as `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`
2. Log into the system as an ADMIN
3. Apply for `GET /api/auth/google/authorize` endpoint to get special link for Google Calendar integration into your profile (as a project manager)
4. After successful page message return to the app's main page and test the system with assigning tasks to some users
